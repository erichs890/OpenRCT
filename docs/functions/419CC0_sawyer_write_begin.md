## Behaviour (observed)

`buf_ptr = buf; buf_count = 0; rle_state = 0; write_error = 0; checksum = 0`.

## Verification

`tests/test_sawyer_io.c::test_writer`: 400 random sessions (data with runs of 1–400 and alphabets of 1–256 symbols, cut into random block/byte/flush operations, with raw bytes in 1 of 4 sessions). For every original call the registers it preserves are checked. The resulting file, the whole `SawyerIO` block, `g_io_busy` and the file position match; every RLE-only session decodes back through the reader; every written checksum validates.
